Ph.D. Candidate in Sociology, KSAS, Johns Hopkins University <br />
Research assistant and student affiliate at Hopkins Population Center, Johns Hopkins University

My dissertation focuses on how social structure in the work and family domains shape individuals' and couples' activity-time allocation across the work, family, and personal domains as an integrated system. I have also contributed to interdisciplinary research projects on (1) social disparities in population health and preventive care, (2) college students' use of generative AI in learning, and (3) population and places in response to environmental hazards. My research combines classic quantitative methods with advanced computational social science techniques.
