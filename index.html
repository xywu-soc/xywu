    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>
      I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Sociology at the Johns Hopkins University and a student affiliate at the Hopkins Population Center. My research focuses on social inequality,
      work and family, and population health, with a strong foundation in quantitative and computational methods. My dissertation looks at social disparities in individuals' 
      organization of daily lives across work, family, and personal domains, asking how social structure in the work and family domains shape activity-time allocation and 
      how gender manifests in the socially structured human behaviors.
