          <h2>About Me</h2>
    
          <p style="font-size:120%;">
            I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Sociology at the Johns Hopkins University and a student affiliate at the Hopkins Population Center. My research focuses on social inequality,
            work and family, and population health, with a strong foundation in quantitative and computational methods. My dissertation looks at social disparities in individuals' 
            organization of daily lives across work, family, and personal domains, asking how social structure in the work and family domains shape activity-time allocation and 
            how gender manifests in the socially structured human behaviors.
          </p>  

          <h2>Research</h2>
    
          <p style="font-size:120%;">
            My dissertation centers on socially structured activity-time allocation in daily life, exploring how work, family, and personal domains interact to reproduce gender and 
            class inequality. I conceptualized daily life as a system of the three domains shaped by social structure in work and family, as well as interpersonal interdependence 
            through socio-economic pairings and division of labor in families. Methodologically, I integrate machine learning with classical statistical methods to overcome empirical 
            limitations and expand the analytic potential of nationally representative datasets, including the American Time Use Survey, the Current Population Survey, and the O*NET 
            occupational database. My work seeks to understand how structural inequality in the labor market and family manifest in individuals’ everyday decisions and behaviors, 
            and how equitable social environments may support more sustainable and inclusive social outcomes for the whole population.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size:120%;">
            In additional to my independent research, I have also collaborated on interdisciplinary research projects on social disparities in population health and preventive care, 
            college students' use of generative AI in learning, and population and places in response to environmental hazards. These projects complement my dissertation research and 
            reflect my broader research interests in how structural forces shape individual behaviors and population-level outcomes. My roles in these research projects include 
            data collection, database management, data cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualization across diverse data types. I have worked with a wide range of data, 
            including survey data, national and county-level population and geospatial data, and structured and unstructured textual data. I developed strong technical 
            skills, workflow management, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the production of timely, high-quality research outputs along the process.
          </p>
    
          <h2>Teaching</h2>

          <p style="font-size:120%;">
            My prior teaching experience mainly focused on research methods in social science, introduction to social statistics, and introduction to computational social science. 
            I am happy to extend my teaching to substantive topics in social science, including social inequality, work and family, and population health.
